=ROC Basics Tutorial=

This book provides a step-by-step introduction to the building blocks
of [[doc:roc:nutshell|Resource Oriented Computing]] (ROC).

It shows how the ROC abstraction supports a range of standard patterns.  Each of which may be achieved
with a very simple, very uniform set of basic building blocks.

==JavaDoc Links==

In the text you will see links such as: {search}INKFRequestContext{/search}.

These links will only work when you have generated and indexed the JavaDoc for the system.

So that you can examine the APIs we link to, run "Generate All" in the [http:/tools/javadoc/|Javadoc] tool, then make sure to [http:/tools/search/fullIndex|reindex] the system
content.

==Source Code==

All of the examples can be found in the '''urn:org:netkernel:tutorial:basics''' 
module.  From a standard installation this will be located in the directory

{java}[ install ]/modules/urn.org.netkernel.tutorial.basics/{/java}

Where [ install ] is the place in your filesystem where you installed NetKernel.

Each part of the tutorial has a corresponding <rootspace> defined in 
the '''module.xml''' file.  For example, Part 1 discusses mapping a fileset to 
a web path.  If you look in module.xml you will find the first rootspace is 
called '''urn:org:netkernel:tutorial:basics:part1''' - this block of XML is 
the complete definition of the part 1 demo address space.

'''P.S.''' If this is your first time reading this and words like 
'''rootspace''', '''mapping''', '''fileset''', '''address space''', etc. do not 
make a lot of sense yet, do not worry, they will after we have gone through 
[[doc:tutorial:basics:part1|Part 1]].

Grateful thanks go to Tom Geudens for reviewing this book, adding comments of encouragement
to the reader in the early stages and teaching the author the basics of English grammar
